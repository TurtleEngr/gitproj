# README for dev-doc

The *.pod files are the master files for generating the *.html and
*.md files.

So if you see a pod file do not edit the corresponding html or md
files--they will be generated with "make gen-dev-doc"

Most of the items in the TODO.md should be moved to
L<issues|https://github.com/TurtleEngr/gitproj/issues>
